      "message": "I would rather opt-in to additional artifacts, hence make the defaults \u003dFalse ?\n\n(it is hard to change the default later, except from False-\u003eTrue)\n\nGenerally, I think I would make those tristate (default: none, true, false)\nThen you can imply dependent settings. E.g. build_boot_images implies build_initramfs (unless it is explicitly set to False).\nIf you find this too complicated, we can still default to False and do implications as above, just we would possibly go against the user parameterization then.",
