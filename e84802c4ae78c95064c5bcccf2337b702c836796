It\u0027s a bit too easy to turn something off in menuconfig or change it from y to m or vice versa which could obviously be a no-go for GKI.\n\n(Our goal had been to patch away \u0027default y\u0027 upstream so fragments would never disable things already present in gki_defconfig (in this case implicitly), but admittedly there is still some work to do there.)",
