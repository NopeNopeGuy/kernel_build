      "message": "I believe LD is one of the next things we can remove, indeed. Though there might be still some uses for LD\u003d\u003csome_linker_flags\u003e while CC\u003d\u003csomething_else_than_clang\u003e is very likely to horribly fail anyway. LD can also pass linker flags.\n\nThe support we are removing here is not for different CC via build config. We are removing the environment variable override only.",
