      "message": "I considered that, but that would change the semantics. Currently, the if body on lines 491-494 does not run in the absence of BOOT_IMAGE_HEADER_VERSION.\nIf we move this up, then it will run even in the absence of BOOT_IMAGE_HEADER_VERSION.\n\nLet me know. I\u0027m fine either way. In fact, I am in favor of moving it up, because then we have a consistent default value for this environment variable. Currently, the script does not behave consistent if BOOT_IMAGE_HEADER_VERSION is not defined.",
