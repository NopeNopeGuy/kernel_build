      "message": "It would also be safe (i.e., consistent in some sense) to just ignore a request for trimming when no symbols are given as this can be consider to the same as supplying a list of all possible symbols. However, keeping up the mathematical consistency argument, strict symbol checking should then fail unconditionally (as no set of symbols from a kernel will ever be the list of all possible symbols).\n\nHowever, not everyone is a mathematician...\n\nPlease check the behaviour of `build.sh` and document any difference (or eliminate it). https://source.corp.google.com/android-common-kernel/build/kernel/build.sh;l\u003d662\n\nOn the mathematical side of things (if you are curious): aosp/1764505",
