      "message": "I think this is the last TODO that I\u0027d like to solve before committing.\n\nIt looks like kleaf sources this file, but it\u0027s done in a way where ROOT_DIR doesn\u0027t have prebuilts/ndk yet (I might be wrong, but commenting back in the below directory check fails during the kleaf build).\n\nMaybe I could move this block into build.sh?  It\u0027s nice having all exported env vars in a source named _setup_env.sh, but we need to do things a little different between build.sh and kleaf for now. Maybe there\u0027s a way to unify some of this though?",
