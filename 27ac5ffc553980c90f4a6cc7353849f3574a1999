      "message": "We can\u0027t just rename this file since partners could be relying on the file modules.load being there. For example, I know Pixel 5 uses the file ${DIST_DIR}/modules.load. So my suggestion is to just keep both files. We could also ask in the GKI newsletter if anyone is using modules.load. If Pixel 5 is the only one, then we can migrate it internally and drop modules.load altogether once a notification has been sent on the newsletter without any partners objecting to it.",
