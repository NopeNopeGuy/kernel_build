      "message": "Does `base_archive` include *all* of the GKI modules, or just the ones that the vendor wants to use? \n\nBasically, I\u0027m wondering how a vendor lists the GKI modules they want to include in their build? For example, the `gki_defconfig` sets `\u003dM` to for all of the GKI modules, but I may only want to ship a subset of these modules. \n\nThere\u0027s an edge-case to this as well which is a vendor may decide to rename a GKI module while overriding it. For example, I may want to override the zram module and in doing so I rename the module to `zram-vendor-a.ko`. If `base_archive` includes `zram.ko`, then based on this logic `modules_staging_dir` will include both `zram.ko` and `zram-vendor-a.ko`.\n\nI know I can control which modules get loaded via the `modules.load` file, but I don\u0027t want to ship the `zram.ko` file if I\u0027m overriding it and don\u0027t plan to load the module.",
