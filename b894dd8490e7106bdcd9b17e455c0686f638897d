      "message": "I checked this command and it does extract all the cpios (only when using the toybox cpio), but the N+1.cpio will overwrite any file that exists in N.cpio. So that means common files like plat_file_contexts, vendor_property_contexts, or default.prop are going to be overridden and only common files in the last vendor ramdisk that\u0027s listed in VENDOR_RAMDISK_BINARY is going to be used.\n\nIs that fine with you? If so, I would at least like this documented so that it\u0027s clear to the user that if multiple vendor ramdisks are used that the last one will take precedence.",
