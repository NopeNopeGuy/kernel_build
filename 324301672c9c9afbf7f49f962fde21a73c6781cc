I am pushing back because I see \"samples\" in the name.\n\nIf you just want to create a build test that these options work, consider one of the following:\n\n* Defining a test kernel_build\n* Do this on the CI on a separate target, with `--defconfig_fragment` pointing to another additional defconfig file with these samples enabled\n* or any other solution that does NOT add them to all kernel builds when --rust is enabled.",
