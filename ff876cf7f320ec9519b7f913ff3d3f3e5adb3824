      "message": "While objcopy and strip are mostly the same tool; how come we don\u0027t fall back to `${CROSS_COMPILE}objcopy` instead?  It would at least be more symmetric to attempt to use `${OBJCOPY}` then fall back to `${CROSS_COMPILE}objcopy` than to fall back to `${CROSS_COMPILE}strip`.  Maybe I\u0027m just splitting hairs here, but was there a technical reason why we fall back to strip and not objcopy?",
