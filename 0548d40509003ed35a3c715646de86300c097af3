      "message": "I generally agree with you. Having a verbose log could be useful. Though a silent build that just prints if something is wrong is also a very good property.\n\nYet, the information printed here is either already in the configuration files (KERNEL_DIR, build.config) or can be easily debugged. So, there is no real need here. For the bazel build, the information here is even persisted in the *env.sh intermediate file. Much better than debugging, actually. :-)",
