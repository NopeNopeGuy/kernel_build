Please put the brackets in, even if they are not needed.\n\nDidn\u0027t know about -delete. I\u0027d have done -exec rm -- \u0027{}\u0027 \u0027+\u0027.\n\nIt might be very slightly neater as -delete -print. So it only prints out each filename once, either it successfully deleted and print the name or it will emit an error message.",
