      "message": "From looking at [0], it appears this depends on `scripts/basic`[1], but that helper only adds a `fixdep` support which I\u0027m not sure is used for `headers_install`, if it didn\u0027t, this would be good as is.\n\nBut looking at L47 I think this is because this is not running trough Kbuild/Makefile and instead running the tool/script directly, which I guess it\u0027s Ok. With the downside that preprocessing from `scripts/Makefile.headersinst` gone, which I think is what L42-43 do here, so all good too?\n\n\n[0] https://cs.android.com/android/kernel/superproject/+/common-android-mainline:common/Makefile;l\u003d1330-1332\n[1] https://cs.android.com/android/kernel/superproject/+/common-android-mainline:common/Makefile;l\u003d636-639",
