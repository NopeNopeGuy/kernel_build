This script might require a bigger rework to make sure that:\n 1. the vendor symbol list is a strict subset of the ABI exported by the kernel image + GKI modules;\n 2. all undefined symbols in vendor modules are in the vendor symbol list.\n \nFollowing my comment on the other CL, all this can be done without maintaining a list of protected symbols I think?",
