      "message": "While I appreciate the change in general, we have to make sure that our build scripts do not require access to non-local resources. In this case we would reach out to sourceware.org. For some environments that is not available during build_abi.sh time. In such cases, folks would decide to distribute prebuilt binaries in a different way through their infrastructure.\n\nI would be ok with an approach where we wrap build_abi.sh (yes, another wrapper :-)) to ensure libabigail\u0027s proper existence; building it from sources if absent.",
