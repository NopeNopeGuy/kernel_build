      "message": "An inclusive list would be the most ideal solution, but we\u0027ll need to spend some time to make the inclusive list look right. That is, we need to come up with some patterns that are not too inclusive (as `**` we are using right now).\n\nI am not very sure about this change. Are these files generated by the IDE or Kbuild?\n\nIf by IDE, there are so many IDEs out there that does all sorts of things, so I am not sure if it is correct to treat one IDE special.\n\nIf by Kbuild, shouldn\u0027t Kbuild put generated files in `O\u003d`? We shouldn\u0027t have generated files in the source tree at all.\n\n---\n\n\u003e Perhaps we can instead read .gitignore ?\n\nNo. We can\u0027t read files at the loading phase.\n\nWe could keep / check-in a separate `ignore.bzl / ignore.scl` file, and use other mechanisms to keep it in sync with .gitignore. But I think it is an overkill.",
