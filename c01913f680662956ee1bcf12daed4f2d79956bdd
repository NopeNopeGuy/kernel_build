So even if ctx.info_file changes, as long as localversion_file does not change, subsequent actions are not re-executed.\n\nThe point is that localversion_file contains only the information for this git project, but not other git projects -- where \"this git project\" means KERNEL_DIR for kernel_build and ext_mod for kernel_module.",
