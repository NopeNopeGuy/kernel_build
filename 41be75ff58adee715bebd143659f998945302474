      "message": "Given that:\n- The list of release blockers for 7.1.0 indicates that it may take some time for the official release\n- There are no known users for --use_prebuilt_gki on android15 branches\n- Even if there are, the downsides are small; it makes a one-time download take longer. (However, downloads are subject to bandwidth constraints in the first place).\n\nI\u0027ll leave this as a TODO and submit it for now to unblock future work. When 7.1.0 is officially checked in, I\u0027ll re-enable parallel download.",
