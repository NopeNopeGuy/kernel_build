Please create a BUILD file in the same or any parent directory. Note that this BUILD file does not need to do anything except exist.\n```\n\nThe error seem to be that `external/bazelbuild-rules_rust/rust/BUILD` does not exist. This appears to be a bug upstream. Perhaps create an empty `BUILD` file there for now and check if the issue is fixed at a later tag, and if not file a bug on Github?",
