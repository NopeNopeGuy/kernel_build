      "message": "we discussed this earlier: we apparently can drop the number of patches and nobody complains, because there is no strict format. Similarly, we could drop the `-` before `ab123456`. The effect is that the `ab123456` is still part of the version string discoverable via uname and the settings dialog. But it will be omitted in the `uname -r` context where the build number rather causes harm (loadable module paths) for portable builds. Can we drop the dash?",
