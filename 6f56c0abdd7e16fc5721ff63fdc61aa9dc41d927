      "message": "Originally I was just going to say: Would it make sense to split out the diff reporting into separate `blaze run` actions?\n\nSTG diff reporting actually generates 4+1 reports and this takes ~1s. The 4 reports are generated with one invocation. The 1 report is generated by textual post-processing of 1 of the 4 reports. The overall exit code is determined - this is a workaround - by the post-processing.\n\nlibabigail diff reporting generates 1 raw and 1 post-processed report (and at an earlier time I might have argued for generating more variations) and this takes a variable amount of time.\n\nGiven that we will retire `abidiff` it may make more sense to insulate the Bazel from some of these things (which will also happen consistently fast).\n\nPerhaps we should add a `diff_abi` mode which does everything and owns the decision-making about whether a build should fail?\n\nI see the ideal outcome as something like:\n\n```\n$ blaze run ...diff...\n[stderr] diff failed, see reports in files blah\n[exit code 1]\n```\n\n```\n$ blaze run ...diff...\n[exit code 0]\n```\n\nand Bazel knows nothing about the report file names.\n\nOr is there a concern that \"generating\" the reports is costly and therefore they should be cached by build system?",
