# Supplied to bazel.py --stdout_stderr_regex_allowlist to enforce that
# only certain lines in stdout / stderr are allowed.
#
# Note: Usually, if you set --stdout_stderr_regex_allowlist to this file,
# you should also run with the following flags:
#
# To bazel:
#    --ui_event_filters=-info,-debug,-stderr
#        (-stderr suppresses "Target X up-to-date" "bazel-bin/..." lines)
#    --noshow_progress
#    --logging=0 (optional)
# To copy_to_dist_dir:
#    --log=warning
