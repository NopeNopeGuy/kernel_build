      "message": "Can I get +2 for this change?\n\nThis fixes the issue to take account of GKI modules during symbol comparison with build.sh. It is already claimed to be working but that\u0027s not the case with build.sh. However, kleaf do account for the GKI modules as an objects for comparison. This will sync build.sh and kleaf and shouldn\u0027t be tied with the GKI module protected/exported symbol list tooling I have been trying to figure out.\n\nRef: https://source.android.com/devices/architecture/kernel/abi-monitor#comparing-kernel-binaries-to-gki-ref-kmi ",

This is actually a bug in current build.sh technically as without this anything set as module in gki_defconfig will cause a build error for \"symbols missing from ksymtab\" which is different from symbols missing from the symbollist.",
