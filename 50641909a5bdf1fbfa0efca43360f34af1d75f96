      "message": "Thanks for checking. I added some detail to b/259292099. I would kindly request we do NOT remove this script until we have a plan to solve the issue explained there. \n\nU-Boot\u0027s integration had a lot of hacks, but these are to work around problems with the prebuilt toolchains in AOSP (specifically, python) so they are not really my fault. Kleaf presently does not provide a way to do the same (b/253562056 and then some, probably). I think this should be addressed before we are pinned to a deprecated version of a removed script that can never be touched, for an actively developed and critical piece of infrastructure for Cuttlefish (x86+ U-Boot).",
