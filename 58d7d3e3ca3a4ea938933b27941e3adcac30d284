If somebody wants to make this target build a top level directory with outputs, we can support referring to outputs by just basename.\n\nE.g. outs \u003d [\u0027vmlinux\u0027] could move up `arch/arm64/boot/vmlinux` to the top level if \u0027vmlinux\u0027 uniquely describes an output file in the out tree.",
