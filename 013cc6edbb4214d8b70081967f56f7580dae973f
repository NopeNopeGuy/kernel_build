      "message": "Though simple and straightforward enough, adds too much flexibility that counters the design rationale of Kleaf. It adds too many \"switches and knobs\" to the build system, which Kleaf tries to reduce when switching from build/build.sh. One disadvantage about build/build.sh is the numerous environment variables controlling different branches everywhere in the build. I would avoid adding environment variables back.",
