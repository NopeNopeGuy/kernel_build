If it needs to be in the version string at all (does it really?), it should be appended after the BUILD_NUMBER as it describes a target within e.g. ab/7141724. For consistency, I would even say, include the full BUILD_TARGET name, so that it reads\n\n  5.11.0-rc7-mainline-03778-gb03736322ddf-ab7141724-kernel_kasan_aarch64\n\nThat gets (internally) resolvable to http://ab/7141724/kernel_kasan_aarch64",

      "message": "Background of this CL:\n\nAppending after the BUILD_NUMBER is what I originally want to do. However ran into some issues when doing that (b/171025979#comment5)\n\n1. Available space is not enough to append build target to version string.\n2. Avoid modifying the public API.\n\nSo previously the solution is pa/1830655. But got -1 because it modifies kernel core. Had a discussion with GKI team (b/171025979#comment12) and we try to use EXTRAVERSION as this CL does. If the problem is replacing of the -rcX, will \n\n 5.11.0-rc7-debug_api-mainline-...\n\nworks for you?",
