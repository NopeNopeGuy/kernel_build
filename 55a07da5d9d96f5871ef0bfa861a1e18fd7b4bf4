      "message": "The python test itself should finish relatively quickly, so I think it is adequate to set it to small size  / short timeout. The large part is the building of the prerequisites of the test (ddk images in this case).\n\nIs my understanding correct?",

      "message": "Hello @lberki@google.com, we have a small test. When the test is executed, it takes a small RAM and runs very quickly. But building the dependencies for it takes a long time. In that case, should we consider it small or large, and should we set timeout to short or long?",
