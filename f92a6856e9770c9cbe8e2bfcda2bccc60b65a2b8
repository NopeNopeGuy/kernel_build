      "message": "It looks like the removal of UNUSED_SYMBOLS was merged in 5.11, and I\u0027m not immediately seeing any kernel older than 5.15 that\u0027s built with kleaf (at least android13-5.10 doesn\u0027t seem to be), so it\u0027s probably OK to remove unilaterally. Is that correct though? Do we have 5.10 kernels or older that support kleaf?",
