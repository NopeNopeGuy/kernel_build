      "message": "Yes, you are right. Things don\u0027t make sense at this point as plans have changed.\n\nWhat I am going to do now is - in new configs being introduced with aosp/1941274 (will also be used by kleaf aosp/1938248 - but doesn\u0027t build yet with kleaf); I\u0027ll set the build flash BUILD_SYSTEM_DLKM and build.sh will only build it if it\u0027s set. That way kleaf will match the build.sh\n\nDoes it sound good?",
