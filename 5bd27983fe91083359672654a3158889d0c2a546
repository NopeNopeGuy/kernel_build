      "message": "@maennich@google.com Looking at the bug, it looks like this is indeed a filesystem issue associated with non-ext4 filesystems.\n\nDo you think it is useful to update the errors.md and sandbox.md to say that \"you need an ext4 filesystem to build with `--config\u003dlocal`; other filesystems are not tested and you may hit permission issues\"?",
