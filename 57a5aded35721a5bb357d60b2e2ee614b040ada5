      "message": "the kernel/build project should never refer to //common, except in very rare cases (which I am also trying to clean up. I think the clang toolchain version is the only one left). This is because:\n\n- partners are likely to check out //common in various different directories. They might forgot that they need to customize these two attributes. Hence, rather we should have a loud failure to force people to specify it.\n\n- We need to cut the dependencies from //build/kernel to //common; //build/kernel needs to be standalone because in the case of DDK, or building modules without sources, there\u0027s no //common at all. Think //build/kernel as a toolchain package; the toolchain package should not depend on sources. It is the other way around.",
